I arrived back in Geneva on Thursday night, after spending a couple of days in Belgium attending Techdays 10. I had a blast, and some of the highlights for me were:

* The presentation by my good friend [Laurent Bugnion](http://geekswithblogs.net/lbugnion/) entitled A day in the life of a WPF/SL. Very cool.
* I had the opportunity to ask [Anders Hejlsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg) about the new .NET 4.0 default parameter feature.
* I attended a presentation on [Moles](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/). Looking forward to using that. One can replace any .NET property or method with a delegate!
* [Scott Hanselman's](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) keynote on day two was just so entertaining. Loved it.

All in all, it was a terrific event.

To top it all off, I discovered my MVP award from Microsoft waiting for me when I arrived home! [MVP profile](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/Vaughan)
