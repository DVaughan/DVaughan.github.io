This is my first blog entry, and with it I would like to dedicate it to [Sacha Barber](http://sachabarber.net/). 
In case you don't know, Sacha is, among other things, a prolific author on CodeProject.com. 
Sacha has been an inspiration to me in the writing of my own articles, and has been a great support. 
I would like to congratulate Sacha for his recent Microsoft MVP and Codeproject.com MVP awards. 
Good on you Sacha.
