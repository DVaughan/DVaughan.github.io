I have just published my latest article entitled Perceptor.

Perceptor is an artificially intelligent guided navigation system for WPF. Perceptor tracks a user's behaviour while he or she interacts with the user interface. Changes to the DataContext of a host control indicate user navigation behaviour, and induce the training of a neural network. Knowledge acquired by the neural network is used to predict the IInputElements to which a user may intend to navigate. This accelerates interface interaction, improves user efficiency, and allows for dynamic and evolving business rule creation.
