I've just launched a [new website](http://www.calciumsdk.net/) for the Calcium project. 
It includes a video on how to use the new version of the Calcium SDK, which I've also just released. 
I'm pretty excited about this one. The new version includes an installer that makes working with Calcium much easier, and a bunch of API refinements.
