I'm here in Redmond attending the annual MVP summit. Besides all the terrific sessions, connecting with product teams, 
and the after parties, I'm excited about what I've seen on the upcoming Apollo release of the Windows Phone OS. 
While an NDA prevents me from providing any detail, I can say that, in my view, Microsoft is making the right choices 
regarding the direction of the phone that will make it an easy choice for business users. I've never been more confident about the future of the platform.

On other news, the terrific people at SAMS have just informed me that Windows Phone 7.5 Unleashed has been shipped to the printer, and the book should be available in vendors shortly after 27 March. Sixteen months, 1150 pages, it's been a long yet enjoyable journey.

Pssst, I'm offering an exclusive preview download of an open-source framework 
that is a consolodation of the book code, to members of the [Windows Phone Experts on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3405242).
