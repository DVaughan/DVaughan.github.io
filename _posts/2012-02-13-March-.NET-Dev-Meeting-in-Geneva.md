After the success of last month's .NET developers meeting in Geneva, we're doing it again!

Feel like meeting up with other developers to discuss Microsoft software development, 
in particular Windows Phone, XAML, WinRT, Silverlight , WPF and ASP.NET? 
Come join us at the Microsoft building in Geneva between the 12th and 16th of March. 
A [poll](http://www.doodle.com/xzyna5kzft3i4bp3) has been set up to narrow down the date. Please let us know if you'd like to attend by adding your name.
We'll be discussing the agenda for the meeting on this [LinkedIn group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Geneva-NET-User-Group-4293457).
