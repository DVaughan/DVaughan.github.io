It's going to be an extremenly interesting meeting this month. A couple of members have volunteered to present, and it's bound to be a lot of fun. If you have *any* small pieces of code or something you find interesting, please feel free to jump up and show it to the group! Don't hold back!

Please feel free to invite your colleagues to the group meeting as well! The more the merrier. We'll have pizza at the meeting! (Thanks Dung)
