Today CodeProject announced the final results for the [Visual Studio 2008 Competition](http://www.codeproject.com/Feature/VS2008/), 
their 'biggest competition yet.' I snuck it in with [Legion](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/gridcomputing.aspx), and then [Sacha Barber](http://sachabarber.net/) 
for [Silverlight 1.1 Fun and Games](http://www.codeproject.com/kb/silverlight/SLFun.aspx). 
This one was way to close to call and, incase you haven't already done so, I highly recommend taking a look at Sacha's article; 
it's superb and could have quite easily won it. Kudos to you Sacha.
