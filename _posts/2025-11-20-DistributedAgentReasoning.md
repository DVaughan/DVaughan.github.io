title: Our New Paper on Distributed Agent Reasoning
published: true
---

We have published a new paper presenting a **novel architecture for distributed agent reasoning** across independent systems, all under strict data locality.

The work shows how agents on separate Orpius deployments can cooperate through natural-language messages, without shared identifiers, schemas, or any centralised data store.
A promising direction for organisations where data cannot move or be unified.
