I've just published the third part of the Calcium series of articles. 
Calcium is now provided as an SDK, and comes with 12 VS Project templates (3 for 2008, 2010, C#, and VB.NET)

It features an introduction to the File Service, which abstracts the displaying of dialogs and handling common IO exceptions, in a platform agnostic manner; allowing the user to select other alternative locations for files, while providing feedback to the user. It also features an overview of the View Service, allowing content to be shown or hidden using a view type association mechanism.
