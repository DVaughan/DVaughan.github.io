I am pleased to announce a new release of the [Clog Client Logging framework](http://clog.codeplex.com/). There are several new features and enhancements. 

* New SkipFrameCount configuration attribute for allowing Clog to be wrapped by a custom adapter.
* Log point short-circuiting, providing the ability to determine if a log level is enabled in order to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary string concantenation etc.
* Formatting overloads.
* Improved concurrency of log strategies.
* Fail safety improved.
* Default WCF configuration for Silverlight Edition.
