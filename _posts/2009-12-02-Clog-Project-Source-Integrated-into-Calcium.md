I am pleased to announce that the [Clog project](http://clog.codeplex.com/) has been integrated into [Calcium](http://www.calciumsdk.net/). 
The source code for both the Silverlight and Desktop CLR Clog projects is now located along with the [Calcium source code on Codeplex](http://calcium.codeplex.com/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx). Why did I take this step? The reason is that there are shared projects across Clog and Calcium, and maintaining two codebases would not be a good thing. One of my goals when publishing software is to make things easy for you. So, a single point of the latest source seems to makes sense. Please note that I will still be releasing Clog binaries on the dedicated Clog Codeplex site. However, the most up to date Clog source can be found with Calcium.
